the speaker should not be part of the dialog thread

need to close the capture thread before we end up going back from the video player.

will also have a audio playback thread

signals not connected

do we need mutex for startcontext signal transfer??

only issue is in decode.

have remvoved video start thread for now so that only one thread has access to file pointer



NOTE: in audio start thread start thread function init parameters are overwritten. remove this
when finishing testing this function.


the audio decode will only work with s32p formats. it is better to encode frame directly in s16le
