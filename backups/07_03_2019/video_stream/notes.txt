the speaker should not be part of the dialog thread

need to close the capture thread before we end up going back from the video player.

will also have a audio playback thread

signals not connected

do we need mutex for startcontext signal transfer??

only issue is in decode.

have remvoved video start thread for now so that only one thread has access to file pointer



NOTE: in audio start thread start thread function init parameters are overwritten. remove this
when finishing testing this function.


the audio decode will only work with s32p formats. it is better to encode frame directly in s16le

queue functions still have some debug print functions.

for now queue size and buffer size are universially defined in structures.

memory freeing in the queue might be an issuse.

for now recording start and stop same with start stop. will later remove start start and stop because video will always be previewed.

issue with exits. not working properly.
